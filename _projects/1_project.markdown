This project was a linguistic investigation of how disputing spouses present themselves via their use of evaluative language in family dispute resolutions. Six episodes of a Chinese reality TV family dispute resolution programme were analysed. The study took a dramaturgical view of the discursive presentation of the ‘self’ and drew on insights provided by the Appraisal framework. The study characterised what is termed the ‘attitudinal dispositions’ of these spouses via tracking tendencies in the range of options for expressing positive/negative attitudes deployed by the spouses. It is proposed that differences in these attitudinal dispositions entail differences in the ‘selves’ being discursively presented, with the notion of ‘self’ having connections with ‘textual identity’ and ‘persona’. In order to group the spouses with respect to similarities and differences in their use of these resources, computational multivariate analysis tools were employed.

There were two lines of inquiry. One attended to the nature of the attitudes the disputants conveyed – what types of attitudes, in what combinations, and at what frequencies. The other focused on how the disputants framed these attitudes – for example, whether they were intensified or mitigated, categorically asserted or modalised. Both a synoptic and a dynamic perspective were adopted in exploring such tendencies – with the synoptic perspective determining frequencies of use of particular attitudinal resources across the entirety of a single segment of the programme, and the dynamic perspective exploring the possibility that the spouses might shift in the course of a single segment from favouring some set of resources to favouring a different set.

    What attitudes did the disputing spouses convey in family dispute resolutions? How did they scale or dialogically frame these attitudes?
    What are the similarities or differences in their attitudes and their framing of the attitudes? What can we know about the disputants' textually constructed identity vis-à-vis their preferences in the attitudes and their framing of the attitudes?

While some common tendencies were observed across the spouses, substantial differences were identified. This provided the basis for proposing that certain sub-types of attitudinal disposition, and hence styles of presentation of the ‘self’ could be identified. Under the dynamic perspective, it was discovered that the attitudinal orientations of the spoused did, indeed, shift both within a single segment of the programme and between different segments, in response to different contextual influences. A key finding, therefore, was that the ‘selves’ thereby being discursively performed were fluid, subject to the influence of the current communicative context, and multifaceted.
