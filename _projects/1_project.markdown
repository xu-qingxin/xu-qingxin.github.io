This project was a linguistic investigation of how disputing spouses present themselves through their use of evaluative language in family dispute resolutions. The study took a dramaturgical view of the discursive presentation of the ‘self’ and drew on insights provided by the Appraisal framework. Computational multivariate analysis tools were employed to group the spouses according to similarities and differences in their use of these resources.

    What attitudes did the disputing spouses convey in family dispute resolutions? How did they frame these attitudes?
    What are the similarities or differences in their attitudes and their framing of the attitudes? What can we know about the disputants' textually constructed identity?
