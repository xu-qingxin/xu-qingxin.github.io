*Title*: Variability in the spouses’ construal of attitudinal disposition in family dispute resolutions 
 

For the spouses in family dispute resolutions, conveying attitudinal assessments involves communicatively and interpersonally more than self-expression of personal viewpoints. The spouses’ attitudinal arrangements indicate their positioning of the self and others, perception of the disputes, and discursive identity construction in front of the mediators. In this presentation, I conduct a multivariate Appraisal (Martin & White, 2005) analysis in a computing environment to explore the variability in the disputing spouses’ attitudinal arrangements. Specifically, I examine six disputing couples who discuss their problems extensively in front of the mediators. By analysing the spouses’ deployment of the attitudinal meaning-making resources, I explore similarities and differences in the spouses’ attitudinal arrangements: which of the resources they used, in what combinations and at what frequencies. Would the patterns of use be broadly similar across the spouses in the dataset, suggesting a uniform or consistent attitudinal disposition enacted by the spouses? Or might these patterns suggest sub-types of attitudinal disposition, with sub-sets of the spouses using the resources in a similar fashion while differing from others? And then, taking this further, do the findings suggest that those attitudinal aspects of discursive self-presentation are broadly similar for all ‘aggrieved’ or ‘wayward’ spouses – they all make similar use of these resources and hence present a similar discursive ‘self’? This presentation contributes to the existing Appraisal/SFL-based textual identity studies by exploring the multifacetedness of discursive self-presentation in immediately interactive, multiparty, adversarial interactions. It also demonstrates how a multivariate analysis with statistical methods can provide worthwhile insights into a linguistic understanding of identity construction.
