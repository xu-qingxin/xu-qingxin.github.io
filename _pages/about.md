**Biography**

I am a Lecturer in English in the [College of Foreign Languages and Cultures at the Xiamen University](https://cflc.xmu.edu.cn){:target="\_blank"}, China. In 2015-2017, I was a visiting scholar at the Confucius Institute at the University of Delaware, U.S.A. 

I am also a PhD candidate in the School of the Arts and Media at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, supervised by [Peter R.R. White](http://prrwhite.info){:target="\_blank"}. My PhD project is about textual identity construction of disputing spouses in family dispute resolutions. I expore *who the disputants are* by reference to what attitudes they held towards each other and how they communicated these attitudes. My thesis is under external examination currently.

**Research**

My research interests include discourse analysis, digital humanities, and Chinese Sign Language linguistics. I primarily analyse people's use of language from Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and the Peircean semiotics perspectives, investigating the relationship between language and identity construction. I deploy a lot of computational tools to assist my linguistic analysis. You can find out more about my [research projects](/xu-qingxin.github.io/projects/), [conference/seminar presentations](/xu-qingxin.github.io/presentations/), [publications](/xu-qingxin.github.io/publications/) and [fundings/awards](/xu-qingxin.github.io/awards/) below.
